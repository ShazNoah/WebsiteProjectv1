      <h2> What to do: </h2>
      <p>  Step 1: Download CFW (Custom Firmware) 3.55 from the "Downloads" Page.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 2: Format your USB Flashdirve to Fat32 format. You can use a tool called "Rufus" from the Downloads Section (Use Portable download link if you don't want to install it)
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 3: Make a folder titled "PS3" and another titled "UPDATE" inside "PS3". Rename your downloaded CFW file to "PS3UPDAT.PUP" and copy this file onto your USB in the "UPDATE" folder. The directory should be PS3>UPDATE>PS3UPDAT.PUP.
       
        <br>
        <br>
        ----WARNING: Turn off your internet connection! Check FAQ for reasoning.----
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 4: Now plug your USB into the PS3, scroll to "System Update" on your XMB and select "Update" then "Via Storage Media"
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 5: On your XMB, Scroll to System Update > From USB storage > Install 
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 6: Wait for the installation process, do Not turn off the console at any point during the process, this could result in the console being stuck in a reset loop, or worse, getting "bricked".
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 7:  Done, Now Check if you are on the correct version by going into "Settings", scroll down to "System Information" and look at your current firmware.

      <h2> Hacked! Lets install some protection packages: </h2>
      <p>  Step 1: Download "SenEnabler", "PsnPatch" & "Multiman" from the "Downloads" page.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 2: Paste these 2 files in the root directory of your USB, no need to make folders. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 3: Plug the USB back into your console, go to the "Games" drop down in your XMB and look for "Install Pkg" or "Install Packages", in there you can choose to install "Pkg" from USB or Storage Media, Install all 3 packages we put in the USB.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 4: Now you'll find these 3 packages as Executable apps in your "Game" section.
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 5: Congrats! You did it! You've modified your console, installed 3 very important packages and now you're ready to download free games, make copies of your current disc versions onto the HDD and hack games!
        <br>
        <br>
        Step 6: A section titled "Hacked - What Next?" will be published on this website in the future, this will contain further guidance on where and how to download over 3000 games and DLC content for free, how to hack some of your favourite titles and possibly more.
