    <!-- Possible Errors and Solutions:
The Ps3 isn’t detecting my USB?
A.	Possible solution 1: Plug the USB in the right hand port (on the right side). Check the names of the folders you created on your USB. It’s case-sensitive and cap sensitive too. If it still doesn’t work, check and make sure you formatted the USB to FAT32 on your computer. 
Possible solution 2: Use a different USB device, on some rare occasions, some USB brands can cause this issue. 
Possible solution 3: It could be the FW file that’s the problem, try downloading a different FW (but do NOT install), just to see if the device and the file shows up. 
Other Methods
If you don’t have a Ps3 Console on Fw 3.55 or lower, there is no way you can perform a downgrade just by overwriting the current FW with a simple install. But there is another method, this guide tells you about the other method but does not provide a tutorial on it.  

                                                             E3 Flasher

An E3 Flasher is a device that can be used to hack into your Playstation 3 console in order to forcibly  downgrade the FW. The cost of  this device depends on the store you buy it from. This method requires you to learn even more, it gets intricate. There are a lot of steps, did I mentioned you have to open your console? Yes past the “Warranty Seal”, but you dgf about warranty because you’re here. In some instances, soldering may also be required. You also need to check the exact model number and name of your PS3 console before you even buy an E3 Flasher because it works on specific models. 
Another way around this:
I can suggest a few ways around the problem of not being able to buy an E3 Flasher and not wanting/having to learn its usage. 

1.	  Use Forums and general research to find local Ps3 modders/hackers who are willing to help. This is free, but requires confidence and involves risk. 
2.	Find a downgrading service!:
These services do exist! People who already own an E3 Flasher and know what they’re doing, sometimes advertise their services to purchase! Try searching your area/city name with “Ps3 downgrade service”. If there’s nothing in your area, expand the search tag to your country. 
The obvious risk involved is that you need to ship your PS3 to have the downgrade performed and delivered back. Here are some tips on the precautions you can take if you want to take this route:
-	Use a well-known site like Ebay or if you’re using a Forum, make sure it’s a big one. 
-	When you do find an advert, check the User’s credentials, look for how old their account is, on sites made for buying and selling you can look for how much Positive Feedback or even Negative, a seller has. On Forums, if it’s a good forum it’ll have the user’s Level and badges that show loyalty, trustworthiness and also their input in the community. 
-	Look at replies made to the advert in the forum(s), don’t take the first positive interaction and possible sale fool you, it could be a fake posted by the “seller”. Look for more than a one off positive feedback. 
-	Finally, if using a platform made for buying and selling, check the refund and buyer protection guidelines to see if you’re covered – in worst case scenario. Maybe even contact support and ask them if they have you covered in case your console doesn’t return within 7 working days.
-	Avoid any listings/adverts that ask for a 14 day period for the service to be performed. The refund policy is usually 14 days long, so this might be a red flag. -->
